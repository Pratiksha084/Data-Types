# Data-Types
PART A & B

THEORY

Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:
Integer
Character
Boolean
Floating Point
Double Floating Point
Valueless or Void
Wide Character
Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
Function
Array
Pointer
Reference
Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
Class
Structure
Union
Enumeration

EXPECTED OUTPUT

PART B

Yes, The image is colorfull

PART C

COMPARISON OPERATOR
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as Boolean values.
A list of all comparison operators:

Operator	Meaning	                     Example	
==	      Equal to	                   x == y	
!=	      Not equal	                   x != y	
>	        Greater than	               x > y	
<	        Less than	                   x < y	
>=	      Greater than or equal to	   x >= y	
<=	      Less than or equal to	       x <= y

CONDITIONAL STATEMENT
C++ has the following conditional statements:
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

ALGORITHM
1.Start
2.Include Headers.
3.Declare and Initialize Variables:num1 and num2.
4.Compare Numbers Using if-else Statements:
The if statement is used to test whether num1 is equal to num2.
The else if statement checks if num1 is less than num2.
The else statement handles the case where num1 is greater than num2.
5.Execute Code Blocks: Depending on the comparison results, the appropriate code block within the if or else if sections is executed.
6.Continue the Program: The program continues with the rest of its logic after the if-else statements.
7.End

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
5 is grater than 3.
